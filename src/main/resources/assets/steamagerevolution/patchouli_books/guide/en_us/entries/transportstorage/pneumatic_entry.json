            "text": "The pneumatics system provides a simple solution for rapid short-distance item transfer. A sender should be placed against the source inventory. Ensure it is facing away from the inventory. Then a maximum of sixteen pneumatic tubes can be placed in a straight line away from the sender. After the tubes a router should then be placed to close the system. One item a second will then be transferred from the source inventory to the router. For longer distance transport the use of minecarts is strongly recommended."
