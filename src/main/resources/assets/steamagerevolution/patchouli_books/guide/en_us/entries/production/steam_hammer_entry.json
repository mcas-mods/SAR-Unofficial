            "text": "The Steam Hammer, much like its smaller handheld brother, smashes things. It replaces the function of said handheld brother, and can also pulverise stone into cobblestone, and then further into sand and gravel. Further to this, the hammer can also be used to reshape objects rather than simply 'deconstructing' them. Plates of metal flatted from ingots can undergo further shaping by placing the appropriate 'die' on the hammer head (right click). Shielding can optionally be placed into the sides of the hammer to prevent things wandering into the crush zone."
